# mpd-lrc

![screenshot](docs/Screenshot.png)

This was for learning purposes (go stuff).

A useless cli to show current song lyrics, using mpd

## Usage

Just create a the config file `mpdLrc.toml` at your `XDG_HOME_CONFIG` or `~/.config`.
Build, and that's it.

```sh
cp docs/config_example.toml ~/.config
```

### TODO

- [ ] fix config file path.
- [ ] Find out why there's two or more active line,
  unless we manually scroll or change window size
